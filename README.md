# monsters-rolodex

## Description
It's a single-page application built with create-react-app. It displays a list of user cards featuring different names and images of monsters. With the search box, we can filter out the cards related to our input. I fetched the users from a given API and used the `useEffect` and `useState` hooks to get the user data appropriately. I generated the monstersâ€™ images with [robohash.org](https://robohash.org). I broke down the application into three different components: `card`, `card-list`, and `search-box`. They can be reused in other situations.
