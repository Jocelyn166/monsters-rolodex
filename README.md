# monsters-rolodex
It's a single page application that is built with create-react-app. It displays a list of users’ cards with different names and images of monsters. With the search box, we can filter out the cards related to our input. I fetched the users from a given API and use the useEffect and useState hooks to get the user data appropriately. I generated the monsters’ images with arobohash.org. I broke down the application into three different components, which are card, card-list and search-box. They can be reused in other situations.
